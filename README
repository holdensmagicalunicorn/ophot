This application requires the following libraries to be installed

* Flask - http://flask.pocoo.org/
* Flask-WTF - http://packages.python.org/Flask-WTF/

To configure this application, edit the configuration file "config.py". You
must add at least USERNAME, PASSWORD, and SECRET_KEY for allowing the
administrator to log in. You probably want to change the NAME, EMAIL, and PHONE
values as well.

Instead of editing the configuration file directly, you can set the
OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to be the path to a file containing the
configuration setting which you wish to set. For example, create a text file
called "myconfig" and add the following:

  USERNAME = "myusername"
  PASSWORD = "mypassword"
  SECRET_KEY = '123456789012345678901234'

Then change the OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to point to that file:

  export OPHOT_SETTINGS=/path/to/myconfig

Before running the application we also need to initialize the database:

  ./reset-db.sh

To run the web server and start serving, run

  python ophot.py

Remember to disable debug mode when running on a production server.
