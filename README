Introduction
------------

This is ophot, a small web application which provides a simple photography
portfolio website. It allows a manager to log in in order to add or remove
photos. It allows viewers to purchase prints of photographs.

This README was last updated on 26 January 2011.

Installing
----------

This application requires the following libraries to be installed:

* Flask - http://flask.pocoo.org/
* Flask-Uploads - http://packages.python.org/Flask-Uploads/
* Flask-WTF - http://packages.python.org/Flask-WTF/
* Python Imaging Library (PIL) - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Using "pip" "easy_install" is probably the easiest way to install these:

  pip install Flask Flask-Uploads Flask-WTF PIL

Configuring
-----------

To configure this application, edit the configuration file "config.py". You
must add at least USERNAME, PASSWORD, and SECRET_KEY for allowing the
administrator to log in. You probably want to change the NAME, EMAIL, and PHONE
values as well.

Instead of editing the configuration file directly, you can set the
OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to be the path to a file containing the
configuration setting which you wish to set. For example, create a text file
called "myconfig" and add the following:

  USERNAME = 'myusername'
  PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
  SECRET_KEY = '123456789012345678901234'

(See the config.py file for more information on how to generate a secret key.)
Next change the OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to point to that file:

  export OPHOT_SETTINGS=/path/to/myconfig

Running
-------

Before running the application we also need to initialize the database. The
reset-db.sh script will create the database for you based on the schema in the
schema.sql file:

  ./reset-db.sh

To run the web server and start serving, run:

  python ophot.py

Remember to disable debug mode when running on a production server.
