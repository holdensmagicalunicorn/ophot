Introduction

This is ophot, a small web application which provides a simple photography
portfolio website. It allows a manager to log in in order to add or remove
photos. It allows viewers to purchase prints of photographs.

Installing
----------

This application requires Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/).

This application requires the following libraries to be installed:

* ConfigObj - http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
* Flask - http://flask.pocoo.org/
* Flask-Uploads - http://packages.python.org/Flask-Uploads/
* Flask-WTF - http://packages.python.org/Flask-WTF/
* Python Imaging Library (PIL) - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Using "pip" or "easy_install" is probably the easiest way to install these:

  pip install Flask Flask-Uploads Flask-WTF PIL configobj

Building as a Python egg
------------------------

This package can be built, installed, etc. as a Python egg using the provided
setup.py script.

Configuring
-----------

To configure this application, edit the configuration file "config.py". You
must add at least USERNAME, PASSWORD, and SECRET_KEY for allowing the
administrator to log in. You probably want to change the values of NAME and
PURCHASE_EMAIL, plus some others as well.

Instead of editing the configuration file directly, you can set the
OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to be the path to a file containing the
configuration setting which you wish to set. For example, create a text file
called "myconfig" and add the following:

  USERNAME = 'myusername'
  PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
  SECRET_KEY = '123456789012345678901234'

(See the config.py file for more information on how to generate a secret key.)
Next change the OPHOT_SETTINGS environment variable to point to that file:

  export OPHOT_SETTINGS=/path/to/myconfig

Running
-------

Before running the application we also need to initialize the database. The
reset-db.sh script will create the database for you based on the schema in the
schema.sql file:

  ./reset-db.sh

To run the web server and start serving, run:

  python runserver.py

Remember to disable debug mode when running on a production server.

One can also deploy this application as a WSGI application, using, for example,
mod_wsgi for Apache. To deploy this application as a WSGI application, edit the
first two lines in the ophot.wsgi file from

  PATH_TO_APP = '/var/www/ophot'
  PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV = PATH_TO_APP + '/env/bin/activate_this.py'

to be the correct paths to the top level directory of the application and the
virtualenv environment in which the application should run, respectively.

Testing
-------

The Python unit tests are contained in the ophot/tests/ directory (which is a
Python package). To run the test suite, run the command

  python setup.py test
